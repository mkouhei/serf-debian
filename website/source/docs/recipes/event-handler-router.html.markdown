# Recipe: Event handler router

Typically you must configure a handler for each type of event you expect to
encounter (more about events and handlers
[here](/docs/agent/event-handlers.html)). To change handler configuration, one
must update the Serf configuration and reload the agent with a SIGHUP or a
restart.

Thanks to the flexibility and open-endedness Serf offers for configuring and
executing handlers, it is possible to achieve similar functionality by
configuring only a single "router" handler, which never needs to be updated.
This removes the orchestration work of reloading the agents by allowing one to
simply drop new executables with predictable names into a directory.

Handler executables must be named by event type for this recipe to work
(e.g. `member-join`). User events get prefixed with "user-", and queries with
"query-" (`user-deploy`, `query-uptime`, etc.).

What you will end up with is a directory structure that looks like this:

```
$ tree /etc/serf
/etc/serf
└── handlers
    ├── member-failed
    ├── member-join
    ├── member-leave
    ├── member-update
    ├── user-deploy
    └── query-uptime
```

## Handler code

The following code must be configured as the only handler for this recipe to
work. It will act as a catch-all this way and be able to make decisions on what
script handler to invoke based on the Serf environment variables.

```
#!/bin/sh
SERFDIR="/etc/serf"
if [ "$SERF_EVENT" == "user" ]; then
    EVENT="user-$SERF_USER_EVENT"
elif [ "$SERF_EVENT" == "query" ]; then
    EVENT="query-$SERF_QUERY_NAME"
fi
HANDLER="$SERFDIR/handlers/$EVENT"
[ -f "$HANDLER" -a -x "$HANDLER" ] && exec "$HANDLER" || :
```
